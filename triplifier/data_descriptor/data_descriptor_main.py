# ============================================================================
# DEPRECATED: This file is being refactored for better modularity
# ============================================================================
# 
# This main file has been refactored into a modular Flask application using:
# - Flask application factory pattern (app.py)
# - Blueprints for route organization (blueprints/)
# - Centralized configuration management (config.py)  
# - Modular utility functions (modules/)
# - Proper separation of concerns
#
# To run the application, use:
#   python app.py
#
# Or for production:
#   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
#
# ============================================================================

# Backward compatibility: Import and run the new application
